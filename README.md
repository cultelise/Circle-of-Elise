# Circle of Elise

My capstone project for the Bright Paths Program.
A community-based web application where members can share, create, and add commentary to posts made by and for other members.


* The circle of Elise web application is coded with no frameworks on the front end and vanilla html, css, and javascript. 
* On the backend, express is utilized in conjunction with cors, Postgres for database, jsonwebtoken for user authentication, and bcrypt for password hashing.
